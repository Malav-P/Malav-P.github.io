Here are some common commands used in the terminal
#### Adding remote repo
Add a remote repo named \<remote-repo\> that points to the url \<remote-url\>

```bash
$ git remote add <remote-repo> <remote-url>
```

#### Push to Multiple Remotes
Suppose we have a repo with a remote.
```bash
$ git remote -v
origin <remote-1-url> (fetch)
origin <remote-1-url> (push)
```

If we want to add a second remote where we push our changes, we can do 
```bash
$ git remote set-url --add --push origin <remote-1-url>
$ git remote set-url --add --push origin <remote-2-url>
```

Then, when it is time to push changes we do 
```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin main
```
